    "### Background\n",
    "Toronto is Canada's largest city, the fourth largest in North America, and home to a diverse population of about 2.8 million people. It is a global centre for business, finance, arts and culture and is consistently ranked one of the world's most livable cities.\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "When you are looking to open a restaurant, how a successful restaurant should be. Of course, food and service are important to the success of a restaurant, but the location can be just as crucial. Therefore, target audience of this project will be people who are looking to open a new restaurant. This project will segment the neighborhoods of Toronto into major clusters and examine their food. The results will help you to decide by discovering culture and variety of the neighborhood."
