    "### Background\n",
    "Toronto is Canada's largest city, the fourth largest in North America, and home to a diverse population of about 2.8 million people. It is a global centre for business, finance, arts and culture and is consistently ranked one of the world's most livable cities.\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "When you are looking to open a restaurant in a popular city as Tonronto city, how to build a successful restaurant. Of course, food and service are important to the success of a restaurant, but the location can be just as crucial. Therefore, target audience of this project will be people who are looking to open a new restaurant. This project will segment the neighborhoods of Toronto into major clusters and examine their food. This quantifiable analysis can be used to understand the distribution of different cultures and food over Canada's largest city. Also, it can be utilized by a new __food vendor__ who want to open his or her restaurant or by a __government authority__ to examine and study their cityâ€™s culture diversity better."
